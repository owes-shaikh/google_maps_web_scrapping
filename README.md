# Google Maps Web Scraping

This Python script allows you to scrape information from Google Maps, extracting valuable data related to locations, businesses, or other points of interest. This web scraping tool utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML content and the requests library for making HTTP requests to the Google Maps website.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Usage

1. Open the script and provide the necessary parameters, such as the target Google Maps URL or search query.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python google_maps_scraper.py
   ```

3. The script will make a request to the specified Google Maps page, extract relevant information, and display or store it as needed.

## Features

- **Location Information:** Extract details such as name, address, phone number, website, and ratings for specific locations.
- **Search Results:** Retrieve a list of search results for a given query, including names, addresses, and additional details.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script based on your requirements. You can modify the URL, search query, or add additional parsing logic to extract specific information.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Ensure you comply with Google's terms of service and policies when scraping data from Google Maps. Be respectful of websites' terms of use and consider the ethical implications of web scraping.

## Dependencies

- `beautifulsoup4`: Library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
- `requests`: Library for making HTTP requests.

## Disclaimer

Web scraping may be subject to legal and ethical considerations. Use this script responsibly and in compliance with relevant terms of service.
